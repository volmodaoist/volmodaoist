LEFT: Efficient Large Entries Retrieval in Network Monitoring
\\
Wei Liang, Yuhui Li, Kun Xie, Naixue Xiong, Dafang Zhang, Kuan-Ching Li

<details close><summary>Paper Summary</summary>
<div markdown="1">
- **My Roles** : Idea, Code&Experiments, Writing
- **Abstract** : We observe that neural tensor completions (NTCs) usually bring better data recovery accuracy and recall performance under brute force searching. However, existing methods can not apply on NTCs and thus, one can not benefit from its better recall performance. This paper introduces LEFT, a differentiable tree-structured indexing model for efficient retrieval of large entries in network-wide monitoring data. LEFT leverages a max-heap tree and the beam search algorithm to determine the positions of top-K entries. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LEFT, outperforming other retrieval baselines and achieving high scalability.

- **My Roles** : Idea, Experiments, Writing
- **Abstract** : For continous network measurement, the tensor is growing. When new data arrives, previous methods can not reach a perfect balance between accuracy and fast recovery. We are the first team to introduce meta-learning methods in tensor completion. We achieve significant   improvement on both accuracy and training time.

EventMon: Real-Time Event-based Streaming Network Monitoring Data Recovery \\
**Yuhui Li**, Wei Liang, Kun Xie, Dafang Zhang, Kuan-Ching Li

<details close><summary>Paper Summary</summary>
<div markdown="1">
- **My Roles** : Idea, Experiments, Writing
- **Abstract** : Existing methods fail to satisfy the requirements of real-time recovery. We propose ResNMMF that achieves ultra-low latency data recovery in network measurement data streams as we process online data as streaming events. In addition, Stream2Batch is proposed to improve training and serving throughput. Extensive experiments show that ResNMMF achieves highly competitive accuracy under anytime inference settings.

LiteTC: Simplifying Neural Tensor Completion via Knowledge Distillation

<details close><summary>Paper Summary</summary>
<div markdown="1">
- **My Roles** : Idea, Experiments, Writing
- **Abstract** : The neural tensor completions adopted in network data recovery suffer from inefficient inference and difficulty in data retrieval. We propose LiteTC ‚Äî a knowledge distillation framework that convert arbitrary advance model into a linear dot-product model, achieving both fast inference and retrieval friendly. Experiments demonstrate the conversion only suffer from reasonable recovery accuracy.

- **My Roles** : Idea, Experiments, Editing
- **Abstract** : We propose a novel subgraph-pattern GNN to inductively extract the rating signal from matrix-induced bipartite graph and enhance it by context-guided sampling. We demonstrate that our model largely outperforms previous methods when in high data sparsity. Our model achieve extrapolation on 25% unseen users/services with just 10% prediction accuracy loss.

- **My Roles** : Idea, Editing
- **Abstract** : It is essential to provide users with the right to erasure regarding their own data, even if such data has been used to train a model, thanks to the GDPR. We propose a framework for QoS prediction, including collaborative signal preservation design and attentive embedding aggregation modules, to support fast retraining and mitigate the performance degradation.

- **My Roles** : Idea, Experiments, Writing
